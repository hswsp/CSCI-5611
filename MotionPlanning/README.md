# Physically-Based-Simulation
## Environment 
processing(JAVA)
## Description
In this assignment,	you	will implement a basic motion planning framework that you will use to animate groups of	agents navigating in complex environments with a variety of obstacles. 
The simulated agents should avoid collisions with both obstacles and other agents, while still reaching their goals. Additionally,	you	will explore methods for simulating group behaviors. 
You will develop several animations that show groups of agents displaying interesting emergent behavior	such as	flocking, herding or lane formation.
